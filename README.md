# FRC-2015_1
Robot code in Java for FIRST Robotics Competition 2015 - Recycle Rush

This was our first try for our FRC program. We were working in Netbeans, and it turns out that we were looking at the wrong infomation for this year.
Netbeans is no longer the supported IDE for FRC, and it would be more trouble than it is worth for us to figure out the go-arounds to use Netbeans.
Rather, we will try again using Eclipse, still writing in Java. We will be using what we found for this code as a basis for our next batch of code that will hopefullt actually work.
